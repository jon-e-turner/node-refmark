# RefMark

JavaScript benchmarking suite designed to acquire two or more git refs, build them, then execute the requested tests. Uses 0x under the hood.

## Set-up

   1. By default, will order results from oldest to newest by last modified
   1. Will be configurable
1. Set the build options, e.g. `npm run build` or `pnpm run typecheck && pnpm run compile`
1. Configure the benchmark tests
1. ???
1. Profit (maybe?)
